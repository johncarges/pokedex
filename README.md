## My Livedex
For the diehard Pokemon enthusiasts, it's not enough to complete the Pokedex. These enthusiasts go above and beyond and complete their Livedex, or Living Pokedex, as well. 

In a Pokedex, if a player catches a Charmander and then evolves that Pokemon into a Charmeleon, the Pokedex will still have Charmander as compete, but the player doesn't actually have a live Charmander anymore. 

Because this is a challenge outside the bounds of the game, there isn't a way to easily track which Pokemon players have in their Livedex. This application aims to let a player track which Pokemon they haven't caught, which ones are only in their Pokedex, and which ones are in their Livedex. 

For this application, the user is able to scroll though the Pokemon in order of Pokedex number. The Pokemon in this list are color coded based on their caught status. The user can click on any individual Pokemon to display detailed information at the top. In the detailed display, the user can update the caught status. The usr can also search for the Pokemon by name in the search bar to pull up a detailed display.
